You (4/14/2023, 9:52:04 AM): I'm trying to review a pick a brick order 
Sophia (4/14/2023, 9:52:06 AM): We try to ship our orders out as quickly as possible, so there’s a very small window where any changes can be made. Let’s check your order and see where it’s at. You can find your order status here: LEGO.build/Orders-CB. 
Sophia (4/14/2023, 9:52:07 AM): If your order status is listed as ‘In process’, you might be able to cancel it yourself. Check your order history page by clicking on ‘View order’. If you see the ‘cancel order’ option, click it to get started! 
Sophia (4/14/2023, 9:52:08 AM): Only entire orders can be canceled. Orders with express shipping or gift cards cannot be canceled. If your order status shows as ‘Just placed’, keep checking back to see if the 'cancel order’ option is available for your order. 
Sophia (4/14/2023, 9:52:10 AM): If your order status shows as ‘In warehouse’ we aren’t able to cancel it, as it’s already being picked and packed for shipping. 
Sophia (4/14/2023, 9:52:11 AM): Of course, I’ll be happy to help, too! What’s the status of your order?
